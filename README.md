# DIESEASE-DETECTION-BRAIN-TUMOR-
Tumor detection is an important task in medical diagnosis, and machine learning techniques have been widely used to improve accuracy and efficiency. Here, we focus on four popular machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), Decision tree and Random Forest Classifier for tumor detection.
